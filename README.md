# Simon-Game

Simon Game is a popular game in which players must repeat random sequences of flashing lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order.
It's fun to play solo or to challenge friends to beat the high score.

It is my first project using the famous JS library, jQuery, as I'm trying to expand my Web Development techniques and knowledge.
